## Can I copy from this?

This is a _heavily modified_ version of [Brittany Chiang's](https://github.com/bchiang7) [v4 website](https://brittanychiang.com), therefore you are more than welcome to copy and use any of the code **with attribution** by linking back to her original website [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com).

If you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).
